Bro Package Manager
===================

:warning: This project is still under development and so may not yet be suitable
          for use in production environments.

The Bro Package Manager makes it easy for Bro users to install and manage third
party scripts as well as plugins for Bro and BroControl.  The Bro Package
Manager command line tool is preconfigured to download packages from a GitHub
repository that has been set up such that any developer can request their Bro
package be included.  This repository is located at:

    https://github.com/bro/packages

See the README file of that repository for information regarding the package
submission process.  Note that it's left up to users to decide for themselves
via code review, GitHub comments/stars, or other metrics whether any given
package is trustworthy as there is no implied guarantees that it's secure just
because it's hosted there.

Or for offline reading, look in the ``docs/`` directory of the source code
distribution.
