Bro Package Manager
===================

Warning: this project is under development and not yet working/complete

The Bro Package Manager makes it easy for Bro users to install and
manage third party scripts and binary plugins.  The Bro Package Manager
command line client, called 'bro-pkg', is preconfigured to download
packages from a GitHub repository that has been set up such that any
developer can request their Bro package be included.  This repository is
located at:

    https://github.com/bro/packages

Please see the README file of that repository for information on the
package submission process.
