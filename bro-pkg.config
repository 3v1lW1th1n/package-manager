# The order of precedence for how bro-pkg finds/reads config files:
#
# (1) bro-pkg --configfile=/path/to/custom/config
# (2) the BRO_PKG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable
# (3) a config file located at $HOME/.bro-pkg/config
# (4) this config file that is installed along with bro-pkg

[sources]
# For Bro Package Manager client commands that don't explicitly specify
# a source, the default source is used.  Its value may be changed to any
# valid Git URL.

# Additional sources may be added as long as they use a unique key with
# a value that is a valid git URL.

[paths]
# Directory where source repositories are cloned, packages are installed, and
# other package manager state information is maintained.
# If left blank, this defaults to $HOME/.bro-pkg
statedir =

# The directory where package scripts are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named 'packages' is always created within the specified path
# and the package manager will copy each package's 'scriptpath' to that
# subdirectory as well as create a symlink within $scriptdir itself that
# points to the package's copied 'scriptpath'.
# If left blank, this defaults to $statedir/scriptdir
# A typical path to set here is $bro_install_prefix/share/bro/site
scriptdir =

# The directory where package plugins are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named 'packages' is always created within the specified path
# and the package manager will work solely within that subdirectory.
# If left blank, this defaults to $statedir/plugindir
# A typical path to set here is $bro_install_prefix/lib/bro/plugins
plugindir =

# The path to the 'bro' executable (e.g. /usr/local/bro/bin/bro).
# This is used by the 'bro-pkg env' command to determine built-in
# BROPATH and BRO_PLUGIN_PATH settings the 'bro' executable uses in the
# case those environment variables aren't set.
# If left empty, the PATH environment variable is searched instead.

# The path to Bro distribution source code.  This is only needed when
