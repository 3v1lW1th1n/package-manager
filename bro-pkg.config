# This is an example config file for bro-pkg to explain what
# settings are possible as well as their default values.
# The order of precedence for how bro-pkg finds/reads config files:
#
# (1) bro-pkg --configfile=/path/to/custom/config
# (2) the BRO_PKG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable
# (3) a config file located at $HOME/.bro-pkg/config
# (4) if bro-pkg is installed along with bro, $prefix/etc/bro-pkg.config
# (5) if none of the above exist, then bro-pkg uses builtin, default
#     values for all settings shown below

[sources]
# The default package source repository from which package manager
# clients fetch packages.  The default source may be removed, changed,
# or additional sources may be added as long as they use a unique key
# and a value that is a valid git URL.
default = https://github.com/bro/packages

[paths]
# Directory where source repositories are cloned, packages are installed,
# and other package manager state information is maintained.
# If left blank, this defaults to $HOME/.bro-pkg
statedir =

# The directory where package scripts are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named 'packages' is always created within the specified
# path and the package manager will copy each package's 'scriptpath' to
# that subdirectory as well as create a symlink within $scriptdir itself
# that points to the package's copied 'scriptpath'.
# If left blank, this defaults to $statedir/scriptdir
# A typical path to set here is $bro_install_prefix/share/bro/site
scriptdir =

# The directory where package plugins are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named 'packages' is always created within the specified
# path and the package manager will work solely within that subdirectory.
# If left blank, this defaults to $statedir/plugindir
# A typical path to set here is $bro_install_prefix/lib/bro/plugins
plugindir =

# The path to the 'bro' executable (e.g. /usr/local/bro/bin/bro).
# This is used by the 'bro-pkg env' command to determine built-in
# BROPATH and BRO_PLUGIN_PATH settings the 'bro' executable uses in the
# case those environment variables aren't set.
# If left empty, the PATH environment variable will be searched for the
# 'bro' exectuable.
bro_exe =

# The path to Bro distribution source code.  This is only needed when
# installing packages that contain Bro plugins that are not pre-built.
